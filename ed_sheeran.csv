Perfect Lyrics

Photograph Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/photograph-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," Loving can hurt, Loving can hurt sometimes, But it's the only thing, That I know. And when it gets hard, You know it can get hard sometimes, It is the only thing that makes us feel alive. We keep this love in a photograph, We make these memories for ourselves, Where our eyes are never closing, Hearts are never broken, And time's forever frozen still. So you can keep me, Inside the pocket, Of your ripped jeans, Holdin' me closer, Till our eyes meet, You won't ever be alone, Wait for me to come home. Loving can heal, Loving can mend your soul, And is the only thing, That I know (know), I swear it will get easier, Remember that with every piece of ya, And it's the only thing we take with us when we die. We keep this love in a photograph, We make these memories for ourselves, Where our eyes are never closing, Our hearts were never broken, And time's forever frozen still. So you can keep me, Inside the pocket, Of your ripped jeans, Holdin' me closer, Till our eyes meet, You won't ever be alone. And if you hurt me, Well that's okay baby only words bleed, Inside these pages you just hold me, And I won't ever let you go. Wait for me to come home, Wait for me to come home, Wait for me to come home, Wait for me to come home. Oh you can fit me, Inside the necklace you got when you were 16, Next to your heartbeat, Where I should be, Keep it deep within your soul. And if you hurt me, Well that's okay baby only words bleed, Inside these pages you just hold me, And I won't ever let you go. When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me, Under the lamppost, Back on 6th street, Hearing you whisper through the phone, Wait for me to come home."

Thinking Out Loud Lyrics

And, darling, I will be loving you till we're 70, And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23, And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways, Maybe just the touch of a hand, Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day, And I just wanna tell you I am So, honey, now, Take me into your loving arms, Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud, Maybe we found love right where we are When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades, And the crowds don't remember my name, When my hands don't play the strings the same way, I know you will still love me the same 'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen, And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory, I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways, And maybe it's all part of a plan, Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes, Hoping that you'll understand That, baby, now, Take me into your loving arms, Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud, And maybe we found love right where we are La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la loud So, baby, now, Take me into your loving arms, Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud, Then maybe we found love right where we are, Oh, baby, we found love right where we are, And we found love right where we are"

Happier Lyrics

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you, But ain't nobody need you like I do, I know that there's others that deserve you, But my darling, I am still in love with you But I guess you look happier, you do, My friends told me one day I'll feel it too, I could try to smile to hide the truth, But I know I was happier with you Baby, you look happier, you do, I know one day you'd fall for someone new, But if he breaks your heart like lovers do, Just know that I'll be waiting here for you"

Supermarket Flowers Lyrics

Castle on the Hill Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/castle-on-the-hill-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," When I was six years old, I broke my leg, I was running from my brother and his friends, And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down, I was younger then, take me back to when I Found my heart and broke it here, Made friends and lost them through the years, And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home I'm on my way, Driving at 90 down those country lanes, Singing to Tiny Dancer, And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real, When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes, Running from the law through the backfields and, Getting drunk with my friends, Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right, but I was younger then, take me back to when, We found weekend jobs, when we got paid, We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight, Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home I'm on my way, Driving at 90 down those country lanes, Singing to Tiny Dancer, And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real, When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill, Over the castle on the hill, Over the castle on the hill One friend left to sell clothes, One works down by the coast, One had two kids, but lives alone, One's brother overdosed, One's already on his second wife, One's just barely getting by, but, These people raised me, And I can't wait to go home And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes, When we did not know the answers, And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real, When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill, Over the castle on the hill, Over the castle on the hill"

Don't Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/dont-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," La, la, la, la I met this girl late last year, She said don't you worry if I disappear, I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake, I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn, But I gave her my time for two or three nights, Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again, She told me I was never looking for a friend, Maybe you could swing by my room around ten, Baby, bring the lemon & a bottle of gin, We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM, Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said, She's singing..., la, la, la, la, Don't with my love, That heart is so cold, All over my own, I don't wanna know that, babe la, la, la Don't with my love, I told her, she knows, Take aim & reload, I don't wanna know that, babe la, la, la For a couple of weeks I only want to see her, We drink away the days with a take away pizza, Before a text message was the only way to reach her, Now she's staying at my place & loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature, And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either, But me & her we make money the same way, Four cities, two planes the same day And those shows have never been what it's about, Maybe we'll go together & just figure it out, I'd rather put on a film with you & sit on the couch, But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out, When she was kissing him how I was confused about, She should figure it out why I'm sat here singing Don't with my love, That heart is so cold, All over my own, I don't wanna know that, babe, Don't with my love, I told her, she knows, Take aim & reload, I don't wanna know that, babe On my hotel door!, I don't even know if she knows what for, She was crying on my shoulder, I already told you, Trust & respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next, But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all, And I never saw him as a threat, Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course It's not like we were both on tour, We were staying on the same hotel floor, And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment, But it was never just fun & I thought you were different This is not the way you realize what you wanted, It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest, And all this time God knows I'm singing Don't with my love, That heart is so cold, All over my own, I don't wanna know that, babe, Don't with my love, I told her, she knows, Take aim & reload, I don't wanna know that, babe Don't with my love, That heart is so cold, All over my own, I don't wanna know that babe, Don't with my love, I told her, she knows, Take aim & reload, I don't wanna know that, babe"

So open your eyes and see, The way our horizons meet, And all of the lights will lead, Into the night with me, And I know these scars will bleed, But both of our hearts believe, All of these stars will guide us home I can hear your heart, On the radio beat, They're playing 'Chasing Cars', And I thought of us, Back to the time, You were lying next to me, I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand, Back through lamplit streets and knew, Everything led back to you So can you see the stars, Over Amsterdam?, You're the song my heart is beating to So open your eyes and see, The way our horizons meet, And all of the lights will lead, Into the night with me, And I know these scars will bleed, But both of our hearts believe, All of these stars will guide us home And oh, And oh, And oh I can see the stars, From America"

",http://www.metrolyrics.com/dive-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," Oh, maybe I came on too strong, Maybe I waited too long, Maybe I played my cards wrong, Oh, just a little bit wrong, Baby I apologize for it I could fall or I could fly, Here in your aeroplane, And I could live, I could die, Hanging on the words you say, And I've been known to give my all, And jumping in harder than, Ten thousand rocks on the lake So don't call me baby, Unless you mean it, Don't tell me you need me, If you don't believe it, So let me know the truth, Before I dive right into you You're a mystery, I have traveled the world, there's no other girl like you, No one, what's your history?, Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?, 'Cause I heard you do, mmh I could fall or I could fly, Here in your aeroplane, And I could live, I could die, Hanging on the words you say, And I've been known to give my all, And lie awake, every day, Don't know how much I can take So don't call me baby, Unless you mean it, Don't tell me you need me, If you don't believe it, So let me know the truth, Before I dive right into you I could fall or I could fly, Here in your aeroplane, And I could live, I could die, Hanging on the words you say, And I've been known to give my all, Sitting back, looking at, Every mess that I made So don't call me baby, Unless you mean it, Don't tell me you need me, If you don't believe it, So let me know the truth, Before I dive right into you, Before I dive right into you, Before I dive right into you"

You Need Me, I Don't Need You Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/you-need-me-i-dont-need-you-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound, Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd, That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now, See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud And I can't, no, I won't hush, I say the words that make you blush, I'm gonna sing this now See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is, I'm like glue, I stick to other artists, I'm not you, now that would be disastrous, Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me, I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy, I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free, Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me 'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you at all, You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you at all, You need me I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, Hell, don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell, Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing, Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool, I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School, I came fast with the way I act, right, I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe And I won't be a product of my genre, My mind will always be stronger than my songs are, Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya, Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia And musically I'm demonstrating, When I perform live, feels like I am meditating, Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me, 'Young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi' 'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you at all, You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you at all, You need me 'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right, I won't stop till my name's in lights, At stadium heights with Damien Rice, On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights, Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice Long nighter, short height and I going hyper, Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah, The game's over but now I'm on a new level, Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal People think that I'm bound to blow up, I've done around about a thousand shows, But I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch, So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out From day one, I've been prepared, With vo5 wax for my ginger hair, So now I'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds, 'Cause it's another day Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic, Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it, And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift, Into another rapper's shoes using new laces I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers, Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for majors, Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back, Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache I hit back when the pen hurts me, I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee, I'm still the same as a year ago, But more people hear me though, According to the MySpace and YouTube videos I'm always doing shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio, Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio, Melody music maker, Reading all the papers, They say I'm up.and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator 'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you at all, You need me, man, I don't need you You need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man, I don't need you at all, You need me, man, I don't need you"

Take It Back Lyrics

I take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love, Come on and take it back for us, Don't you fade into the back love No I take it back with the rhythm and blues, With my rap pack I'll be singing the news, Tryin' act like Jack Black, When I bring it to school, I make a beat with my feet, By just hittin' the loop, Bringing the lyrics to prove, That I can fit in these shoes, I give you the truth through the vocal booth, And stars burst out on the scene, Like an opal fruit, They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot, But then again that's what they're supposed to do, And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm, Whispering everything that happens, Is from now on I'll be ready to start again By the end of the song, Since they are claiming I handled it wrong, But then I've never had an enemy, Except the NME but I'll be selling, Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be, With only spectacles ahead of me, And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree, Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids, I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic, I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it This song's from the heart cover the planet, I take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love, Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love, No, And take it back now Now I don't ever wanna be perfect, Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless, And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed, Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus, Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton, Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless, Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition, 'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written, Now absence can make your heart ache, But drinking absinth can change your mind state, Vividly need to let my liver be, And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends, Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me, And I hope to see him blowing up globally, 'Cause that how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally, It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, But, but I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be, But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out, It's time to take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love, Come on and take it back for us, Don't you fade into the back love, No Mmm come on and take it back love, Come on and take it back for us, Don't you fade into the back love, No"

Wake Me Up Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/wake-me-up-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," I should ink my skin, With your name, And take my passport out again, And just replace it See I could do without a tan on my left hand, Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle, And I should run you a hot bath, And fill it up with bubbles 'Cause maybe you're loveable, Maybe you're my snowflake, And your eyes turn from green to gray, In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place, And you should never cut your hair, 'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder And you will never know, Just how beautiful you are to me, But maybe I'm just in love, When you wake me up And would you ever feel guilty, If you did the same to me?, Could you make me a cup of tea, To open my eyes in the right way? And I know you love Shrek, Because we've watched it 12 times, But maybe you're hoping, For a fairytale too And if your DVD breaks today, You should've got a VCR, Because I've never owned a Blue-Ray,, True say And now I've always been shit at computer games, Because your brother always beats me, And if I lost, I'd go across, And chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you'd laugh at me, And be asking me, If I'm gonna be home next week, And then you lie with me, Till I fall asleep, And flutter eyelash on my cheek, Between the sheets And you will never know, Just how beautiful you are to me, But maybe I'm just in love, When you wake me up And I think you hate the smell of smoke, You always try and get me to stop, You drink as much as me, And I get drunk a lot So I take you to the beach, And walk along the sand, And I'll make you a heart pendant, With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like a necklace, So the heart falls where your chest is, And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach, And it falls just where it needs to be, And rests peacefully, So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now, Against yours now 'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up, Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up, Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"

U.N.I. Lyrics

Nina Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/nina-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," I met you when I was a teen, But then you were one as well, And I could play a guitar, Just like ringing a bell, Sometimes I wonder,, In any other summer, Could you be a part time lover to me, Listening to Stevie Wonder?, Under the covers where we used to lay, And re stacks is what the speakers played, I'd be on tour almost every day When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay Just watching a dvd, smoking illegal weed, Getting high as two kites when we needed to breath, We'd use each other's air just for the people to see, And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep, We'd go anywhere our minds would take us, And I'd say you were beautiful without your make up, And you don't need even to worry about your weight cause We can all be loved the way that god made us, And time's the only reason that we could break up Cause you would always tell me I was away too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake So say it again Oh Nina, you should go Nina Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina, Oh won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road Nina, But then again you should know Nina Cause that's you and me both Nina, Oh won't you leave me now? And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie, With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold, Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own, Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone Watching blue planet, creating new habits, Acting as if we was two rabbits, And then you'd vanish Back to the burrow with all the Celtics, I'd disappear, you'd call me selfish, I understand but I can't help I put my job over everything except my family and friends, But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back, Overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break, Just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late, So we can either deal with pain and wait to get on a plane, But in a day we'd have to say it again Oh Nina, you should go Nina Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina, Oh won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road Nina, But then again you should know Nina, Cause that's you and me both Nina, Oh won't you leave me now? Love will come and love will go, But you can't make it on your own Sing that song, Go oh won't you leave me now?, People grow and fall apart, But you can't mend your broken heart, Take it back, Go oh won't you leave me now?, Ooh Oh Nina, you should go Nina, (Love will come and love will go, but you can't make it on your own), Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina, (Sing that song), Oh won't you leave me now?, (Go oh won't you leave me now?), And I've been living on the road Nina, oh (People grow and fall apart), But then again you should know Nina, (But you can't mend your broken heart), Cause that's you and me both Nina, (Take it back), Oh won't you leave me now?, (Go oh won't you leave me now?), Now? Oh Nina, you should go Nina, (Love will come and love will go, but you can't make it on your own), Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina, (Sing that song), Oh won't you leave me now?, (Go oh won't you leave me now?), And I've been living on the road Nina (I've been living on the road), (People grow and fall apart), But then again you should know Nina (then again you should know), (But you can't mend your broken heart), Cause that's you and me both Nina (cause that's you and me both), (Take it back), Oh won't you leave me now?, (Go oh won't you leave me now?), Now?"

Hands of Gold (Game of Thrones) Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/hands-of-gold-game-of-thrones-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," He rode through the streets of the city, Down from his hill on high, O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles, He rode to a woman's side, For she was his secret treasure, She was his shame and his bliss, And a chain and a keep are nothing, Compared to a woman's kiss. For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm, For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm. And there he stood with sword in hand, The last of Derry's ten, And red the grass beneath his feet, And red his banners bright, And red the blow of the setting sun, That bathed him in its light, C'mon c'mon the great lord called, My sword is hungry still. And with the cry of savage rage, They swarmed across the rill, And with the cry of savage rage, They swarmed across the rill. He rode through the streets of the city,, Down from his hill on high,, O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles, He rode to a woman's side,, For she was his secret treasure, She was his shame and his bliss, And a chain and a keep are nothing, Compared to a woman's kiss. For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm, For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm, For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm, For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm"

Drunk Lyrics

Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, To feel a little love I wanna hold your heart in both hands, Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can, And I've got no plans for the weekend, So should we speak then?, Keep it between friends?, Though I know you'll never love me like you used to There may be other people like us, Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up, Flames just create us, Burns don't heal like before, And you don't hold me anymore On cold days cold plays out like the band's name, I know I can't heal things with a handshake, You know I can change,, As I began saying, You cut me wide open like landscape, Open bottles of beer but never champagne, To applaud you with the sound that my hands make, Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, To feel a little love All by myself, I'm here again, All by myself, You know I'll never change, All by myself, All by myself I'm just drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, To feel a little love"

The Man Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-man-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," Now I don't wanna hate you, Just wish you'd never gone for the man, And waited two weeks at least, Before you let him take you, I stayed true, I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school, He's waiting for the time to move, I knew he had his eyes on you, He's not the right guy for you, Don't hate me cause I write the truth, No, I would never lie to you, But it was never fine to lose you, And what a way to find out!, It never came from my mouth, You never changed your mind, But you were just afraid to find out, But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject, I love it, I'll make your little secret public, it's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet, To get back at me, Trapped and I'm lacking sleep, Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually, You're practically my family, If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be, But tragically our love just lost the will to live But would I kill to give it one more shot?, I think not I don't love you baby I don't need you baby, I don't want you no, Anymore I don't love you baby, I don't need you baby, I don't wanna love you no, Anymore Recently I tend to zone out, Up in my headphones to Holocene, You promised your body but I'm away so much, I stay more celibate than in a monastery, I'm not cut out for life on the road, Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much, And at the time we'd just go, So sue me, I guess I'm not the man that you need, Ever since you went to UNI, I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack, Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad, But when I broke the industry, That's when I broke your heart, I was supposed to chart and celebrate, But good things are over fast, I know it's hard to deal with and see this, I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features, Then I turn the music off And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus, I never really want to believe this, Got advice from my dad, And he told me that family is all I'll ever have and need I guess I'm unaware of it, Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with I don't love you baby I don't need you baby, I don't want you no, Anymore I don't love you baby, I don't need you baby, I don't wanna love you no, Anymore And since you left, I've given up my days off, It's what I need to stay strong, I know you have a day job, But mine is 24/7, I fell like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could, The irony is if my career and music didn't exist, In 6 years yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid, I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink, And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's, Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill, And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill, Go down in history as just a wasted talent, Can I face the challenge, Or did I make a mistake erasing? It's only therapy, My thoughts just get ahead of me, Eventually I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be, Either way I guess I'm not prepared But I'll say this, These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit, Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty, But I had to get this off my chest I don't love you baby, I don't need you baby, I don't want you no, Anymore I don't love you baby, I don't need you baby, I don't wanna love you no, Anymore"

Float down, Like autumn leaves, And hush now, Close your eyes before the sleep, And you're miles away, And yesterday you were here with me Ooh, how I miss you, My symphony played the song that carried you out, And ooh how I miss you, And I miss you and I wish you'd stay Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? Float down, Like autumn leaves, And hush now, Close your eyes before the sleep, And you're miles away, And yesterday you were here with me (Mmm-mm-mmh, mm-mmh, Mmm-mm-mmh, mm-mmh), (Mmm-mm-mmh, mm-mmh, Mmm-mm-mmh, mm-mmh) Touch down, Like a seven four seven, Stay out, And we'll live forever now."

New Man Lyrics

Eraser Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/eraser-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind, Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine, I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride, The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind, So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life, Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride, And when the world's against me is when I really come alive, And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride, You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs, I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun, I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up, Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become, I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me, Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree, To be caught up in the trappings of the industry, Show me the locked doors, I find another use for the key, And you'll see I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me, But with that said give me one more, higher, Another one to take the sting away, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay, Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs, I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong, I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell, Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well, And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps, Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun, Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run, I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become, Our conversations with my father on the A14, Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams, Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me, With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans, Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou', I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud, And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now, Somehow I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me, But with that said give me one more, higher, Another one to take the sting away, Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay, Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser, And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser, And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser Welcome to the new show, I guess you know I've been away, But where I'm heading, who knows, But my heart will stay the same Welcome to the new show, I guess you know I've been away, But where I'm heading, who knows, My pain, eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser, And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser, And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser, And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser"

So open your eyes and see, The way our horizons meet, And all of the lights will lead, Into the night with me, And I know these scars will bleed, But both of our hearts believe, All of these stars will guide us home I can hear your heart, On the radio beat, They're playing 'Chasing Cars', And I thought of us, Back to the time, You were lying next to me, I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand, Back through lamplit streets and knew, Everything led back to you So can you see the stars, Over Amsterdam?, You're the song my heart is beating to So open your eyes and see, The way our horizons meet, And all of the lights will lead, Into the night with me, And I know these scars will bleed, But both of our hearts believe, All of these stars will guide us home And oh, And oh, And oh I can see the stars, From America"

Castle on the Hill Lyrics

",http://www.metrolyrics.com/castle-on-the-hill-en-espanol-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," When I was six years old, I broke my leg, I was running from my brother and his friends, And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down, I was younger then, take me back to when I Found my heart and broke it here, Made friends and lost them through the years, And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home I'm on my way, Driving at 90 down those country lanes, Singing to Tiny Dancer, And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real, When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes, Running from the law through the backfields and, Getting drunk with my friends, Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right, but I was younger then, take me back to when, We found weekend jobs, when we got paid, We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight, Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home I'm on my way, Driving at 90 down those country lanes, Singing to Tiny Dancer, And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real, When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill, Over the castle on the hill, Over the castle on the hill One friend left to sell clothes, One works down by the coast, One had two kids, but lives alone, One's brother overdosed, One's already on his second wife, One's just barely getting by, but, These people raised me, And I can't wait to go home And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes, When we did not know the answers, And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real, When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill, Over the castle on the hill, Over the castle on the hill"

Cold Coffee Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/cold-coffee-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," She's like cold coffee in the morning, I'm drunk off last night's whisky and coke, She'll make me shiver without warning, And make me laugh, as if I'm in on joke And you can stay with me forever, Or you could stay with me for now And tell me if I'm wrong, And tell me if I'm right, Tell me if you need a loving hand, To help you fall asleep tonight, Tell me if I know, Tell me if I do, Tell me how to fall in love The way you want me to, I'll wake with coffee in the morning, But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea, Outside, the day is up and calling But I don't have to be, So please go back to sleep And stay with me forever, Or you could stay with me for now, And tell me if I'm wrong, And tell me if I'm right, Tell me if you need a loving hand, To help you fall asleep tonight, Tell me if I know Tell me if I do, Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to 'Cause I love the way you wake me up, For goodness sake will my love not be enough? Tell me if I'm wrong, Tell me if I'm right, Tell me if you need a loving hand, To help you fall asleep tonight, Tell me if I know, Tell me if I do, Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to, Tell me if I'm wrong, Tell me if I'm right, Tell me if you need a loving hand, To help you fall asleep tonight"

Diary Lyrics

And your love,, Has never been my enemy., Used to hold me, And promise it would never leave., Never been better since all the therapy, To read the words between the lines, And take away my melody., And your love,, Told me it was going to a different page., And you know, if I let you go,, I'll still keep you safe. If you could only say the words, I'd take it and I'd write it down, And hold it deep inside of me, Until the day you found me out, But I know your love, And that's why I could be your diary,, Baby if you open me up., Keep it inside me,, I'll give you the world, Just give me the words., And I could be your diary,, Baby if you open me up., Keep it inside me,, I'll give you the world, Just give me the words. You are the one I fall asleep with, But never wake up to, Cause work is something you must do, I trust you like you trust me, It must mean true love, It does exactly what it says on the tin, Let me begin, You are the one I watch the movies with, For recognizing my love for Kiera Knightley for what it truly is, Just an excuse so I don't have to watch Love Actually again, But you're actually the same, It's just to spite me, And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it, Until the dishes finished, Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it, I tried to make tea once for you in bed, But all I did was spill it, So you made it for me instead, Let me in bed, If you get in ahead of me, It's better to do, Yeah, love is ahead of the truth, But in love, We are better in two, I'll be the newcomer, Stuck in heaven with the devil in you Diary, Baby if you open me up., Keep it inside me,, I'll give you the world, Just give me the words., And I could be your diary,, Baby if you open me up., Keep it inside me,, I'll give you the world, Just give me the words., Yeah"

Don't Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/dont-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," La, la, la, la I met this girl late last year, She said don't you worry if I disappear, I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake, I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn, But I gave her my time for two or three nights, Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again, She told me I was never looking for a friend, Maybe you could swing by my room around ten, Baby, bring the lemon & a bottle of gin, We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM, Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said, She's singing..., la, la, la, la, Don't with my love, That heart is so cold, All over my own, I don't wanna know that, babe la, la, la Don't with my love, I told her, she knows, Take aim & reload, I don't wanna know that, babe la, la, la For a couple of weeks I only want to see her, We drink away the days with a take away pizza, Before a text message was the only way to reach her, Now she's staying at my place & loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature, And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either, But me & her we make money the same way, Four cities, two planes the same day And those shows have never been what it's about, Maybe we'll go together & just figure it out, I'd rather put on a film with you & sit on the couch, But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out, When she was kissing him how I was confused about, She should figure it out why I'm sat here singing Don't with my love, That heart is so cold, All over my own, I don't wanna know that, babe, Don't with my love, I told her, she knows, Take aim & reload, I don't wanna know that, babe On my hotel door!, I don't even know if she knows what for, She was crying on my shoulder, I already told you, Trust & respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next, But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all, And I never saw him as a threat, Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course It's not like we were both on tour, We were staying on the same hotel floor, And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment, But it was never just fun & I thought you were different This is not the way you realize what you wanted, It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest, And all this time God knows I'm singing Don't with my love, That heart is so cold, All over my own, I don't wanna know that, babe, Don't with my love, I told her, she knows, Take aim & reload, I don't wanna know that, babe Don't with my love, That heart is so cold, All over my own, I don't wanna know that babe, Don't with my love, I told her, she knows, Take aim & reload, I don't wanna know that, babe"

Drunk Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/drunk-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," I wanna be drunk when I wake up, On the right side of the wrong bed, And never an excuse I made up, Tell you the truth I hate, What didn't kill me,, It never made me stronger at all Love will scar your makeup,, Lip sticks to me, So now I maybe lean back there, I'm sat here,, Wishing I was sober, I know I'll never hold you like I used to But a house gets cold when you cut the heating, Without you to hold I'll be freezing, Can't rely on my heart to beat in, Cause you take parts of it every evening, Take words out of my mouth just from breathing, Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?', Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, To feel a little love I wanna hold your heart in both hands, Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can, And I've got no plans for the weekend, So should we speak then?, Keep it between friends?, Though I know you'll never love me like you used to There may be other people like us, Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up, Flames just create us, Burns don't heal like before, And you don't hold me anymore On cold days cold plays out like the band's name, I know I can't heal things with a handshake, You know I can change,, As I began saying, You cut me wide open like landscape, Open bottles of beer but never champagne, To applaud you with the sound that my hands make, Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, To feel a little love All by myself, I'm here again, All by myself, You know I'll never change, All by myself, All by myself I'm just drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again, To feel a little love"

Eraser Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/eraser-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind, Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine, I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride, The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind, So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life, Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride, And when the world's against me is when I really come alive, And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride, You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs, I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun, I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up, Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become, I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me, Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree, To be caught up in the trappings of the industry, Show me the locked doors, I find another use for the key, And you'll see I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me, But with that said give me one more, higher, Another one to take the sting away, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay, Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs, I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong, I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell, Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well, And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps, Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun, Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run, I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become, Our conversations with my father on the A14, Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams, Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me, With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans, Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou', I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud, And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now, Somehow I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me, But with that said give me one more, higher, Another one to take the sting away, Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay, Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser, And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser, And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser Welcome to the new show, I guess you know I've been away, But where I'm heading, who knows, But my heart will stay the same Welcome to the new show, I guess you know I've been away, But where I'm heading, who knows, My pain, eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser, And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser, And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser, And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser"

Family Lyrics

I don't know about days gone,, But round here nobody lives twice., When your gone, your gone, without no bye,, Because only a judge can give you life., This is my advice,, Trust me, I nearly lost my life., 3 weeks after I got this rhyme,, It seems like I had too much wine., Which that I I didn't get one,, Anyway, I was going to the? booked for a set,, Even though I didn't have a set one., Skream hit the decks, I was like check one., Put on a show, but it weren't my best one., Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination,, Then I was off to the next one,, 20 minutes later I was on the M1,, Tired., But I kept on going,, Fell asleep without even knowing., No motion in my face,, No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going., Woke up,, Lorry,, Flash,, Panic,, Break,, Skid,, Crash,, Skidded,, More,, Bang,, Smash,, Out,, Cold,, Ribs,, Cracked,, Ouch., I was in so much pain,, Crawled out of a Megan that now looked like a Mini,, When I was still on the first lane., Baffled, didn't even know my name., Fainted, too much shock in my brain., Surrounded by paramedics and feds,, Trying to get up but fainted again. I just want you to take a second, hear me out., Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out., I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared,, Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,, To see my family,, And keep it inside,, Dry eyes, while my brother weeps., Save my soul,, Please Father let me go., Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps. Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open,, I can hear voices and my phone ringing., Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning,, One of the worst situations I've been in., I can hear all of the angels singing. But when it stopped humming,, My brain turned on, stared running., Still in pain, but it started numbing,, the stone cold comeback I made was stunning., I still tried to do a few shows cuz I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming., But I was left with a permanent problem,, Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside)., Ever so cunning,, 6 weeks later, jogging and running., I used the first air kit like a drum set,, Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming., Trust me, when it comes to mistakes,, You can't afford to let one in., Never done dream for a while,, The black plan was blocked,, So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing., They say tomorrow never dies,, But he forgot to tell you 'you can'., You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang,, But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam., You can try beg for another,, Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show,, Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother',, Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner. I just want you to take a second, hear me out., Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out., I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared., Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,, To see my family., And keep it inside,, Dry eyes, while my brother weeps., Save my soul."

",http://www.metrolyrics.com/galway-girl-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," She played the fiddle in an Irish band, But she fell in love with an English man, Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand, Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance"" I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar, She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar, She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?, Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?, She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun, She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun, Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar, Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band, But she fell in love with an English man, Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand, Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance"", With my pretty little Galway Girl, You're my pretty little Galway Girl You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool, And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room, As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool, After dancing to Ceilidh singing to trad tunes, I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet, A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat, Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week, And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band, But she fell in love with an English man, Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand, Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance"", My pretty little Galway Girl, My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl, My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl, My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time, I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine, Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine, As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night, I walked her home then she took me inside, To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine, I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write, About a Galway Girl and a perfect night She played the fiddle in an Irish band, But she fell in love with an English man, Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand, Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance"", My pretty little Galway Girl, My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl, My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl, My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl"

Hands of Gold (Game of Thrones) Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/hands-of-gold-game-of-thrones-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," He rode through the streets of the city, Down from his hill on high, O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles, He rode to a woman's side, For she was his secret treasure, She was his shame and his bliss, And a chain and a keep are nothing, Compared to a woman's kiss. For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm, For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm. And there he stood with sword in hand, The last of Derry's ten, And red the grass beneath his feet, And red his banners bright, And red the blow of the setting sun, That bathed him in its light, C'mon c'mon the great lord called, My sword is hungry still. And with the cry of savage rage, They swarmed across the rill, And with the cry of savage rage, They swarmed across the rill. He rode through the streets of the city,, Down from his hill on high,, O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles, He rode to a woman's side,, For she was his secret treasure, She was his shame and his bliss, And a chain and a keep are nothing, Compared to a woman's kiss. For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm, For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm, For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm, For hands of gold are always cold, But a woman's hands are warm"

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you, But ain't nobody need you like I do, I know that there's others that deserve you, But my darling, I am still in love with you But I guess you look happier, you do, My friends told me one day I'll feel it too, I could try to smile to hide the truth, But I know I was happier with you Baby, you look happier, you do, I know one day you'd fall for someone new, But if he breaks your heart like lovers do, Just know that I'll be waiting here for you"

And now I'm sitting on a night bus, Flicking through my Ipod, Feeling kinda tired, So I try to close my eyes up, Driver, turn the lights off, Lights on, on stage, mics on Song plays, nice one, Gotta keep my hype strong, Truth be, never went to Uni, People see right through me, But I'm not a fool see, I'm never gonna do one, Gonna live past 22, done, Everything I need to, Except get a 2: 1 I haven't slept for the past week, Two hours ain't enough for me, I feel inspired, at quarter to three, am, I haven't changed since our last meet, I'm still getting all my meal's for free, Think I'm being shunned by my feet again It's not a homeless life for me, it's just I'm home less than I'd like to be It's not a homeless life for me When I feel cold, You keep me warm, And I'm not looking for some loose change, Wanna find a true mate, Who wants to be my duvet, It's not a homeless life for me, it's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me, yearh, mh, oh."

Standing in the corner, Shadowed by the light, To you I seem much smaller, But I know it might be you, How much better could I do, To be myself, not someone else?, I'm losing sleep, I live only for the week I've grown to ignore you, Cos when I seem to bore you, You pretend that you're not interested, Your eyes start to twinkle, Your smile starts to widen, And I just seem to try and forget, But you pay me no attention, Even though I do, But I don't care as long as you're mine, It's happening every time All I gotta do is pass you by, Never say what's wrong, Whenever I say why? Standing in the corner, Shadowed by the light, To you I seem much smaller, But I know it might be you, How much better could I do, To be myself, not someone else?, I'm losing sleep, I live only for the week And I'm falling harder now it seems, My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams, And I can't sleep although I think I can, It's insomnia I think I have, But who cares when I'm not your man? Standing in the corner, Shadowed by the light, To you I seem much smaller, But I know it might be you, How much better could I do, To be myself, not someone else?, I'm losing sleep, I live only for the week"

Lately Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/lately-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be, Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees, Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe., Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep, Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any, Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many, Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon, 'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true, We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables, To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme, So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine, ""'Cause real will recognise real"" is what my father says, And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away, Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close. 5 o'clock with lights off, Interview with a vampire, Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require, I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead, Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z, Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers, Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired, And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying, 'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game, It's time to wage war, Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives, 2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight, I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line, Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,, Be wide awake just like your snorting lines Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by, I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be, The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be..., The times I'm living in lately. I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out, Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron, But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded, Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in, It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with, Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in, I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows, Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con, I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow, Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework, Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older, I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie, Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die., Never die., 2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws, Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes, And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,, Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move, We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do,, Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true!, I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em, We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em, In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment, Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got,, I keep my pupils engaged,, Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake., I never sleep, When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,, The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... The times I'm living in lately."

Move on, forget it, Now move on, forget it All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it, Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music, Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who... what the fuck does it matter?, Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder, It don't matter to me, All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely, To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?, Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?"

Nina Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/nina-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," I met you when I was a teen, But then you were one as well, And I could play a guitar, Just like ringing a bell, Sometimes I wonder,, In any other summer, Could you be a part time lover to me, Listening to Stevie Wonder?, Under the covers where we used to lay, And re stacks is what the speakers played, I'd be on tour almost every day When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay Just watching a dvd, smoking illegal weed, Getting high as two kites when we needed to breath, We'd use each other's air just for the people to see, And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep, We'd go anywhere our minds would take us, And I'd say you were beautiful without your make up, And you don't need even to worry about your weight cause We can all be loved the way that god made us, And time's the only reason that we could break up Cause you would always tell me I was away too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake So say it again Oh Nina, you should go Nina Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina, Oh won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road Nina, But then again you should know Nina Cause that's you and me both Nina, Oh won't you leave me now? And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie, With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold, Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own, Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone Watching blue planet, creating new habits, Acting as if we was two rabbits, And then you'd vanish Back to the burrow with all the Celtics, I'd disappear, you'd call me selfish, I understand but I can't help I put my job over everything except my family and friends, But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back, Overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break, Just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late, So we can either deal with pain and wait to get on a plane, But in a day we'd have to say it again Oh Nina, you should go Nina Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina, Oh won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road Nina, But then again you should know Nina, Cause that's you and me both Nina, Oh won't you leave me now? Love will come and love will go, But you can't make it on your own Sing that song, Go oh won't you leave me now?, People grow and fall apart, But you can't mend your broken heart, Take it back, Go oh won't you leave me now?, Ooh Oh Nina, you should go Nina, (Love will come and love will go, but you can't make it on your own), Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina, (Sing that song), Oh won't you leave me now?, (Go oh won't you leave me now?), And I've been living on the road Nina, oh (People grow and fall apart), But then again you should know Nina, (But you can't mend your broken heart), Cause that's you and me both Nina, (Take it back), Oh won't you leave me now?, (Go oh won't you leave me now?), Now? Oh Nina, you should go Nina, (Love will come and love will go, but you can't make it on your own), Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina, (Sing that song), Oh won't you leave me now?, (Go oh won't you leave me now?), And I've been living on the road Nina (I've been living on the road), (People grow and fall apart), But then again you should know Nina (then again you should know), (But you can't mend your broken heart), Cause that's you and me both Nina (cause that's you and me both), (Take it back), Oh won't you leave me now?, (Go oh won't you leave me now?), Now?"

All my senses come to life, While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I, Have ever been and I'll never leave again, 'Cause you are the only one, And all my friends have gone to find, Another place to let their hearts collide, Just promise me, you'll never leave again, 'Cause you are the only one Take my hand and my, Heart and soul, I will, Only have these eyes for you, And you know,, Everything changes but, We'll be strangers if we see this through We could stay within these walls and bleed, Or just stay with me? All my senses come to life, While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I, Have ever been and I'll never leave again, 'Cause you are the only one, And all my friends have gone to find, Another place to let their hearts collide, Just promise me, you'll always be a friend, 'Cause you are the only one Stumbling half drunk, Getting myself lost, I am so gone, So tell me the way home, I listen to sad songs, Singing about love, And where it goes wrong All my senses come to life, While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I, Have ever been and I'll never leave again, 'Cause you are the only one, And all my friends have gone to find, Another place to let their hearts collide, Just promise me, you'll always be a friend, 'Cause you are the only one"

One Night Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/one-night-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," Lying in a bedroom, Lighting up a Benson, Face hair is growing, So I cut with a vengeance, Hey, did I mention, As she makes an entrance, Said I had a tendency, To finish off a sentence, Oh well, she's a local girl, No make-up 'cause she knows me well, Hair tied up in elastic band, With a kiss on the cheek, For her one-night man, Is it fast food, I'll regret it after?, And I needed money, But I'm too shy to ask her, So she buys me chips and cheese, And I tell her I love her, And she's all I need, I take it with a cold glass, Of the fruit and the barley, She's still a sucker, For the apple and Bacardi, Heading to the party, Sitting in the car seat, B.E.P. on radio, It makes me feel naughty, She knows me well, Bit of a catch to have a local girl, Hair tied up in elastic band, With a kiss on the cheek, For her one-night man, I don't wanna go alone, I don't wanna go alone, I don't wanna go alone, Tell her that I love her, Tell her that I need her, Tell her that she's more, Than a one-night stand, Tell her that she turns my cheeks, The color of my hair, All I wanna do is be near, Tell her that I want her, Tell her that I need her, Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand, Tell her that I love her, More than anyone else, If you don't, I'll tell her myself, And we've got love in us, So if the drink kill us, We're gonna dance all night, 'Til the floor fillers, If we talk outside, I say I hate wasps too, I don't really dance, So I'll just watch you, Are you taking me back tonight?, Tell me if that's alright, I don't wanna be here, I'm not the sofa type, Tell me if you have a toothbrush, You don't mind sharing, She said I wanna take off, What you're wearing, I don't wanna go alone, I don't wanna go alone, I don't wanna go alone, Tell her that I love her, Tell her that I need her, Tell her that she's more, Than a one-night stand, Tell her that she turns my cheeks, The color of my hair, All I wanna do is be near, Tell her that I want her, Tell her that I need her, Tell her that she's more, Than a one-night stand, Tell her that I love her, More than anyone else, If you don't, I'll tell her myself, She's like the fast food, I'll regret it after, And I needed money, But I'm too shy to ask her, But she buys me chips and cheese, So I tell her that she's all I need, Tell her that I, Tell her that I, Tell her that she's more, Than a one-night stand, Tell her that she turns my cheeks, The color of my hair, All I wanna do is be near, Tell her that I, Tell her that I, Tell her that she's more, Than a one-night stand, Tell her that I love her, More than anyone else, If you don't, I'll tell her myself, Tell her that I love her, Tell her that I need her, That she's more, Than a one-night stand, Tell her that she turns my cheeks, The color of my hair, All I wanna do is be near, Tell her that I want her, Tell her that I need her, Tell her that she's more, Than a one-night stand, Tell her that I love her, More than anyone else, If you don't, I'll tell her myself"

Photograph Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/photograph-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," Loving can hurt, Loving can hurt sometimes, But it's the only thing, That I know. And when it gets hard, You know it can get hard sometimes, It is the only thing that makes us feel alive. We keep this love in a photograph, We make these memories for ourselves, Where our eyes are never closing, Hearts are never broken, And time's forever frozen still. So you can keep me, Inside the pocket, Of your ripped jeans, Holdin' me closer, Till our eyes meet, You won't ever be alone, Wait for me to come home. Loving can heal, Loving can mend your soul, And is the only thing, That I know (know), I swear it will get easier, Remember that with every piece of ya, And it's the only thing we take with us when we die. We keep this love in a photograph, We make these memories for ourselves, Where our eyes are never closing, Our hearts were never broken, And time's forever frozen still. So you can keep me, Inside the pocket, Of your ripped jeans, Holdin' me closer, Till our eyes meet, You won't ever be alone. And if you hurt me, Well that's okay baby only words bleed, Inside these pages you just hold me, And I won't ever let you go. Wait for me to come home, Wait for me to come home, Wait for me to come home, Wait for me to come home. Oh you can fit me, Inside the necklace you got when you were 16, Next to your heartbeat, Where I should be, Keep it deep within your soul. And if you hurt me, Well that's okay baby only words bleed, Inside these pages you just hold me, And I won't ever let you go. When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me, Under the lamppost, Back on 6th street, Hearing you whisper through the phone, Wait for me to come home."

Quiet Ballad Of Ed Lyrics

Take It Back Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/take-it-back-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow, I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know, You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in, I never want to get bitten, Cause plagiarism is hidden, Watch how I sit on the rhythm, Prisoner with a vision, Signed to a label, But didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't, So perk your ears up and listen, Studio is the system, And you could say that I'm driven, And now it's onto the next saga, We drink the best lager, I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather, I do my own thing now, And get respect after, And I'm avoiding the 'caine, Like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay, But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded, Like a paper weight, At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home, I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked, Went from sleeping at a subway station, To sleeping with a movie star, And adding to the population, Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love, Come on and take it back for us, Don't you fade into the back love No I take it back with the rhythm and blues, With my rap pack I'll be singing the news, Tryin' act like Jack Black, When I bring it to school, I make a beat with my feet, By just hittin' the loop, Bringing the lyrics to prove, That I can fit in these shoes, I give you the truth through the vocal booth, And stars burst out on the scene, Like an opal fruit, They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot, But then again that's what they're supposed to do, And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm, Whispering everything that happens, Is from now on I'll be ready to start again By the end of the song, Since they are claiming I handled it wrong, But then I've never had an enemy, Except the NME but I'll be selling, Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be, With only spectacles ahead of me, And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree, Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids, I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic, I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it This song's from the heart cover the planet, I take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love, Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love, No, And take it back now Now I don't ever wanna be perfect, Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless, And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed, Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus, Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton, Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless, Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition, 'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written, Now absence can make your heart ache, But drinking absinth can change your mind state, Vividly need to let my liver be, And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends, Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me, And I hope to see him blowing up globally, 'Cause that how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally, It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, But, but I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be, But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out, It's time to take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love, Come on and take it back for us, Don't you fade into the back love, No Mmm come on and take it back love, Come on and take it back for us, Don't you fade into the back love, No"

The Man Lyrics

It's only therapy, My thoughts just get ahead of me, Eventually I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be, Either way I guess I'm not prepared But I'll say this, These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit, Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty, But I had to get this off my chest I don't love you baby, I don't need you baby, I don't want you no, Anymore I don't love you baby, I don't need you baby, I don't wanna love you no, Anymore"

And, darling, I will be loving you till we're 70, And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23, And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways, Maybe just the touch of a hand, Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day, And I just wanna tell you I am So, honey, now, Take me into your loving arms, Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud, Maybe we found love right where we are When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades, And the crowds don't remember my name, When my hands don't play the strings the same way, I know you will still love me the same 'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen, And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory, I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways, And maybe it's all part of a plan, Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes, Hoping that you'll understand That, baby, now, Take me into your loving arms, Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud, And maybe we found love right where we are La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la loud So, baby, now, Take me into your loving arms, Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud, Then maybe we found love right where we are, Oh, baby, we found love right where we are, And we found love right where we are"

U.N.I. Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/uni-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," I found your hair band on my bedroom floor, The only evidence that you've been here before, And I don't get waves of missing you anymore, They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes Never getting dry, so I get high, Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on, Weeks pass in the blink of an eye, And I'm still drunk at the end of the night, I don't drink like everybody else, I do it to forget things about myself, Stumble and fall with the head spin I got, My mind's with you but my heart's just not So am I close to you anymore, if it's over?, And there's no chance that we'll work it out That's why you and I ended over U.N.I., And I said that's fine, But you're the only one that knows I lied, You and I ended over U.N.I., And I said that's fine, But you're the only one that knows I lied Everybody said we'd be together forever, But I know that I never wanna settle down,, Come around, break up the love like lego now, Never wanna turn into another like you, Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views Everything's great, not everything's sure, But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus, Now I'm in position to be another stalker, Like everything I say seems to always sound awkward Like our last kiss, it was perfect, But we were nervous, on the surface, And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it, Pain is only relevent if it still hurts, I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative, And go back to the day we fell in love just on first kiss So am I close to you anymore, if it's over?, And there's no chance that we'll work it out Oh you and I ended over U.N.I., And I said that's fine, But you're the only one that knows I lied, You and I ended over U.N.I., And I said that's fine, But you're the only one that knows I lied Because, if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now, And maybe I can let myself down, And I'm thinking I'm unaware, I keep my feet on the ground, And keep looking around,, To make sure I'm not, The only one to feel low Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered, From all that I've done wrong, And I know you'll say, That I'm the only one, But I know God made another one of me, To love you better than I ever will 'Cause you and I ended over U.N.I., And I said that's fine, But you're the only one who knows that I lied, You and I ended over U.N.I., And I said that's fine, But you're the only one who knows that I lied"

Undone Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/undone-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," Made of clay, Shoot me down, I'll ricochet to the ground, Words of paint, Draw me out, And fill me in with your mouth, And hold your tongue, And I know it's over before it's begun, I lost my way, So help me out, And lend your hand 'til I am found, My voice is mute, Not to be heard, So it's up to you, For you to bring those words, I, And I, Have come undone, For the last time, This grief you give, It takes it's toll, It dries my heart and drowns my soul, I am a tree, Whose branch you broke, The brittle wood has turned stones, oh, I, And I, Have come undone, For the last time, For the last time, For the last time, I, And I, Have come undone, For the last time, For the last time, For the last time"

Wake Me Up Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/wake-me-up-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," I should ink my skin, With your name, And take my passport out again, And just replace it See I could do without a tan on my left hand, Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle, And I should run you a hot bath, And fill it up with bubbles 'Cause maybe you're loveable, Maybe you're my snowflake, And your eyes turn from green to gray, In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place, And you should never cut your hair, 'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder And you will never know, Just how beautiful you are to me, But maybe I'm just in love, When you wake me up And would you ever feel guilty, If you did the same to me?, Could you make me a cup of tea, To open my eyes in the right way? And I know you love Shrek, Because we've watched it 12 times, But maybe you're hoping, For a fairytale too And if your DVD breaks today, You should've got a VCR, Because I've never owned a Blue-Ray,, True say And now I've always been shit at computer games, Because your brother always beats me, And if I lost, I'd go across, And chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you'd laugh at me, And be asking me, If I'm gonna be home next week, And then you lie with me, Till I fall asleep, And flutter eyelash on my cheek, Between the sheets And you will never know, Just how beautiful you are to me, But maybe I'm just in love, When you wake me up And I think you hate the smell of smoke, You always try and get me to stop, You drink as much as me, And I get drunk a lot So I take you to the beach, And walk along the sand, And I'll make you a heart pendant, With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like a necklace, So the heart falls where your chest is, And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach, And it falls just where it needs to be, And rests peacefully, So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now, Against yours now 'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up, Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up, Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"

Way Home Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/way-home-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," Well I once heard a story about a run-down home, Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone, He tried to live, no effort was shown, He's slowly finding a way back home He had a family with smiles and frowns, They never could solve his way to be down, Cause he's one dog who don't want a bone, He's slowly finding a way back home He had a nice house with windows and doors, He said to his wife what's mine is yours, But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown, He's slowly finding a way back home His children have left but the rooms are still there, His misses the noise and the scents in their hair, But far from the nest the babies have flown, He's slowly finding a way back home His wife was an angel sent from above, He never returned her kisses or love, But soon he'd found that she'd overgrown, This man who's finding a way back home So the leaves are all dead in this broken man's June, The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon, He stares at the floor, no more to roam, He's slowly finding a way back home Well I once heard a story about a run-down home, Where a man with regrets lived all alone, He tried to live, no effort was shown, He'll never find a way back home"

What Do I Know Lyrics

Love can change the world in a moment, but what do I know?, Love can change the world in a moment The revolution's coming, it's a minute away, I saw people marching in the streets today, You know we are made up of love and hate, But both of them are balanced on a razor blade I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene, I know, I'm all for people following their dreams, Just remember life is more than fitting in your jeans, It's love and understanding, positivity We could change this whole world with a piano, Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go, I'm just a boy with a one-man show, No university, no degree, but Lord knows Everybody's talking about exponential growth, And the stock market crashing in their portfolios, While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote, Saying: ""Love could change the world in a moment, but what do I know?"" Love can change the world in a moment, but what do I know?, Love can change the world in a moment I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene, You know the future's in the hands of you and me, So let's all get together, we can all be free, Spread love and understanding, positivity We could change this whole world with a piano, Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go, I'm just a boy with a one-man show, No university, no degree, but Lord knows Everybody's talking about exponential growth, And the stock market crashing in their portfolios, While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote, Saying: ""Love could change the world in a moment, but what do I know?""

And did they get you to trade Your heroes for ghosts?, Hot as he's for trees? Hot air fora cool breeze?, Cold comfort for change?, And did you exchange, A walk on part in the war, For a lead role in a cage? How I wish, how I wish you were here., We're just two lost souls Swimming ina fishbowl, Year after year, Running over the same old ground., What have we found? The same old fears., Wish you were here, Wish you were here"

pressure from haters, Became invaded with sadists, And just developed a hater radar I'm aimed for the stars, Kept my grind in the dark, Then they came with the remedy kicking rhymes with the melody, Hennessey shots and all these fools on the block, Who said you've got to be a gangster now to raise the top I'm just a normal casual usual everyday type of guy with my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran urban angel, Coming ready to die, So see the signs, Stand at the side, Open your eyes and take a look and realise, The resurrection's arrived, And as the mist clears, I arise from my tomb in the skies All alone Alonestar, Urban angel rising from the ashes surprising, No haters, guiding no moving, I'm steady you can find me in the club Bottle full of bub, Mummy, I've got the X if you're into taking

Now my eyes are red Cos you need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man,, My eyes are red, You need me, man, I don't need you at all, You need me, My eyes are red, You need me, man, I don't need you, You need me, man,, My eyes are red, You need me, man, I don't need you at all, You need me, Man, I don't need you"

You Need To Cut Your Hair Lyrics
",http://www.metrolyrics.com/you-need-to-cut-your-hair-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html," Well I walked from my house to yours, In a warm cold April rain, We barely went outdoors, And your family took the blame, Take time to be with you, She can only glare, I'm a bad influence, that'll do, 'Cause I need to cut my hair, Wash my mouth, change my clothes, Just don't talk to those friends of yours, Tell them not to come here anymore, Time to go, don't be slow, This'll only take a mo', Take yourself right out of my door It's just that they don't care, Dad said beware, watch your back, Just don't reply to that woman there, And even if she makes a fuss, Just ignore that trust, And don't give in to lust, And leave that one alone, The girl's trouble Time spent in burnt-down shed, Add up near two days, Fall down and cut my head, Take time to misbehave, Spend time and be with you, She can only glare, 'Cause you're a bad influence, that'll do, Boy you need to cut your hair, Wash your mouth, change your clothes, Just don't talk to those friends of yours, Tell them not to come here anymore, Time to go, don't be slow, This'll only take a mo', Take yourself right out of my door It's just that they don't care, Dad said beware, watch your back, Just don't reply to that woman there, And even if she makes a fuss, Just ignore that trust, And don't give in to lust, And leave that one alone This is the dancing song, Close your eyes, Hypnotise to the beat, And the movement of the week, Do that shuffle of your feet, And pound out the fever, either, Dance as you're a true believer, Cleaner lives are what you don't see, Fell the weight, gravitate, Feel the pace of me, This world is 2D, The only thing that's free in life is love, And that don't come cheap It's just that they don't care, Dad said beware, watch your back, Just don't reply to that woman there, And even if she makes a fuss, Just ignore that trust, And don't give in to lust, And leave that one alone, The girl's trouble"
